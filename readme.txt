##Training code###
python train_classifier_resnet.py

Since the dataset we have is very small, I used transfer learning for this task.

##Testing_code
python test_classifer.py

For running test code, replace the path with test_path wwith th test images path. The structure of test images hsould be same as that of Val_data which is already in the Data folder.
